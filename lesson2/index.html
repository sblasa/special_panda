    <h1>Sussette's Learning - Home Page </h1>
    <p>I really didn't have any topics that I was interested in, so I decided to use my learning as my topic for this site. </p>
Here's where to start:
<li><a href="about.html">About This Site</a></li>
<li><a href="https://codecareeracademy.com/">Code Career Academy' Site</a></li>
    <div>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting Started</a></li>
        <li><a href="week1_day1.html">Week 1</a>
    </ol>
