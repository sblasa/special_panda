            <p>I was able to view the first class on Vimeo today. I was a day behind because Code Career Academy class is 
            three hours ahead, and it takes several hours for the video to process.
            It was still exciting (how geeky, huh?)--that I'm excited to learn more about programming/coding.
            HTML hasn't changed much, though at least I don't have to write out the whole "DTD-put-version-of-html-here-stuff" in the
            DOCTYPE tag. I can hear myself now--look here, back in MY day, we had to write out 
            the entire version of HTML in the DOCTYPE! And it was snowing!</p>
