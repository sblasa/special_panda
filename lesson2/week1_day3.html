        <p>Oh, git. Sometimes I just don't git you! Oh, that was a bad pun. Well,
            I said it anyway. I think it took me about 30 minutes to remove the repo that I
            had previously messed up. Oh, yes, I was trying to be all techy and stuff by trying to 
            remove the .git directory by command line (yeah, don't even make fun of me), but 
            the files were still there--yes, I followed directions! So I ran out of patience and went
            through Windows explorer and deleted the directory, and readded (is that spelled right?) 
            the repo for the correct directory.
        </p> 
        <p>Yes, I kind of git it now. (Really, that's the last pun.) </p>
